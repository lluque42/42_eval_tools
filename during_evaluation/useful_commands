To check every function call from the compiled objects in obj/
while filtering some names and listing them sorted and one time
per function name:

	nm obj/* | grep " U " | sort -u | grep ft_* -v | grep ph_* -v | awk '{print $2}'

To copy & paste the subject allowed functions text, format it as
a sorted list to ease checking against the former command output:

	cat allowed_functions_bonus | tr -s , "\n" | tr -d " " | sort
